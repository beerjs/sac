# BeerJS Sacramento

BeerJS Sacramento provides an opportunity for Sacramentoans (and visitors) to get together to discuss Javascript while enjoying a tasty beverage in an informal and unstructured environment. While the discussions will be predominantly Javascript oriented, anything is fair game! Who knows, maybe we'll even do coffee one day.
